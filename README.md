# PyAssist
PyAssist is the Python Digital Assistant. It is designed to do various tasks on a linux computer.

It is a GUI interface that encorporates the Speech_Recognition api as well as others such as the web browser,
and goslate apis. More apis are used but come ready with ubuntu and or python itself.

You can download different mods to add to the main.py. These mods will usually have dependencies

    create a GUI (graphical user interface)
    set up python to do many more functions for future tinkering`

- Takeways:

   `Pip lets us install python libraries
    Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia apis help our application get data
    WxPython give our application a window to work on`
